                    <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
                    <p> I am an undergraduate student of Simon Fraser University at Surrey, BC, 
                        presently working towards a degree in BSc. Computer Science - Software Systems since 2017.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Programming is my passion. I love the pleasant feeling that comes from solving complex problems. 
                        Although Iâ€™m currently a university student seeking co-op jobs, my career goal is to 
                        become a professional software developer. I am interested in building and designing websites as well. 
                    </p>

                        Besides coding, I love to travel and hike to various locations. 
                        Wandering around beautiful streets or nature is the way I relieve the stress. 
                        I also love to build new relationships with different people by having conversations 
                        to get to know each other. 
                    </p>
